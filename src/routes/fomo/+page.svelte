<h1>FOMO</h1>
<p class="content">
  One of the main goals of this whole shindig is to reconnect with folks I haven't seen in a while.
  Many of you live far away from NYC, dislike large gatherings, or are welcoming a new baby into
  your lives (a weirdly large number of you, actually). If, for whatever reason, you can't make it
  to the party, I would still love to hear from you.

<p class="content">
  If you're the type to talk it out, please call <strong>(512) 522-7336â€¬</strong> and leave me a voicemail. I promise I
  won't pick up! And if you're more of a writer, please drop me a line at <a class='email' href="mailto:evanfortybarden@gmail.com?subject=Hi Evan">evanfortybarden at gmail</a> to share a
  fond memory, what you think of my whole deal, or a time I was wrong about something.
  Anything, really. I miss you and it'll be really nice to hear from you.
</p>

  Of course, you are always encouraged to just call or text my ass, but maybe this feels bit a nicer, or
  <em>intentional</em>, and you don't need to worry about interrupting me while I yell at someone
  for parking in a bike lane.

  More of a card person? Do whatever you want! You have my address.
