<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">I'm coming from out of town. Where do I stay?</span>
	  <div slot="details">
		  <p class="content">
      Doubtful of how many people will actually travel for this thing, there are no hotel blocks.
      I know, hotels are expensive...especially during fashion week. If you are cool with crashing
      on a couch or air mattress, or you would like to split a hotel with someone you may
      (or may not) know, please drop me a line and I will help coordinate!
      </p>
      <p class="content">
      If you're going to book a hotel, I would suggest one in Williamsburg, Greenpoint, or Manhattan
      within walking distance of 14th Street. But those are just the ideal places. Any Manhattan
      hotel should be fairly easy, as well as anything close to the G or L train.

<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">I live in NYC or booked a hotel and have extra space. Is that helpful?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Yes, that would be very helpful. If you're down to host an out-of-town guest, please let me know
  and I will put you in touch. Thank you in advance!

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">Are my children allowed?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Absolutely. They are welcome and will be celebrated. However, there may be some loud music and
  there will be approximately zero toys, so depending on their age, they may need hearing protection
  or adult conversational skills. There will be a music-free backyard though and, if enough kids are
  coming, I'll try to get some funny coloring books or other activies for that space. No promises!

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">Will there be any attempts to make this a COVID-safer event?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  This is one of the primary reasons we found a venue with outdoor space. If the weather
  cooperates, the back yard will be a viable option the entire time. Indoors, masks are encouraged
  and celebrated. I will probably not wear one because I am vain and love photos, but I will love
  that you are wearing a mask and protecting my friends and family. We will also have masks
  available for anyone who wants one and I will try to get some air purifiers.
  Thanks for caring about this as NYC closes its last public testing site. We are on our own.

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">Is Pete's wheelchair accessible?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Yes, it is. The entrance is fully accessible, but I will warn that the bathrooms are a bit tight
  and may not be up to code.

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">Will I know anyone at the party?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  If we have any mutual friends, you can assume that some if not most of them are invited. If you
  are anxious about this, text me. In the rare chance you don't know anyone at the party, please
  just chat with a stranger. They are all really nice and most of them are funny.
</p>

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">Will my ex be there?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  I'm not gonna lie to you. Unless I specifically picked a side or wrote someone off, there's a
  decent chance I have invited them. Are they actually coming? You'll have to text me to find out.
  Just so you're not alone, I'll try invite an ex or two of my own.

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">Will there be food?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Yes, but I wouldn't necessarily count on it for a meal. Think plant-based pizza, plant-based Thai
  food, maybe some chips and dips, a sweet treat or two. Those who are caught unprepared or find
  themselves peckish will be sustained, but I would have lunch beforehand if you are someone who
  gets hangry. I believe Pete's also sells grilled cheeses.

	<span slot="head">Is it an open bar?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  At least until the minimum runs dry! Come early if you're concerned about this, you lush.

	<span slot="head">Will there be non-alcoholic beverages available?</span>

  You bet your bippy.

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">Okay so what really is the dress code?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  "New York best" just means to dress up a little and try to swag out. Have fun. All levels of
  formality are welcome and you will be celebrated equally for wearing a tux as you will be for
  cosplaying indie sleaze. I will also love you if you just show up normal.

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">What do you want for your birthday?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  What?! omgggg. You do not have to do that. One year when I was like 10, I asked for a box of
  peppermint patties and a head of iceberg lettuce. I got both and it was heaven. So, I'm easy.
  Your attendance is enough of a gift. But...if you have a fun talent to contrubute to the
  party, lmk.

	<span slot="head">Will this conflict with DIRT softball?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Not if everyone plans to shower at Dom's. Game is at 1pm, party starts around 2pm. So a quick
  shower at Dom's will get folks feeling fresh and at the party in no time. Or you can do that at
  home. We'll be going til ~6:30pm.

<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">September 13th is literally my birthday, wtf?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Genuinely I'm sorry, but this had to be on a Saturday and the 20th was too close to Rosh Hashanah.

	<span slot="head">Wait, when is your actual birthday?</span>

  Monday, September 15th. Double Virgo, baby.

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">The party description is kind of vague. Will this be fun?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Great question. You don't trust me and you're right to be skeptical. I haven't earned it. As of
  this writing, we're going to have a great DJ and my friends The Cherry Fog are going to play. If
  that sounds like fun to you, then you will be very happy. If that doesn't sound like fun, that's
  why there is a music-free backyard where you can post up.

<!-- question -->
<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">What's up with the after party?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Less planned. After dinner. I will probably just pick a bar, maybe even one with dancing, and tell
  people to meet me there. If you are busy during the day, this is something to do that night.

<Accordion>
	<span slot="head">I haven't see you in YEARS. What's going on in your life?</span>
	<div slot="details">
<p class="content">
  Yes! Perfect. Read this and we can skip that whole slog on the day of the party. I want to hear
  about YOU anyway. Okay, so what have I been up to? Since moving to NYC in 2010 (actually Hoboken
  for the first year)...I have taken so many improv classes and done so many improv shows. I've also
  done a lot of sketch comedy, most recently with my team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/youngdouglas"
  target="_blank">Young Douglas</a>. We are currently writing a longform narrative heist which should
  debut sometime in the next year. I worked at a FinTech company for awhile, then had a mish mash of
  jobs at a comedy theater, a children's arts and education company, a boutique tutoring service,
  and I even tried doing Postmates for a hot minute. Then almost three years ago I went to a coding
  bootcamp and I am now a frontend web developer for a big insurance company. I still do improv at
  Magnet Theater and I co-host a comedy talk show about urban life called
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PowerJokerShow" target="_blank"> The Power Joker</a>. I lived in
  Astoria for eight years and now Greenpoint for the last six. Along the way, I hosted a podcast with
  one of my best buds, biked all around the city, blogged about going on one hundred dates, went on
  a few hundred more dates (give or take), and then met my incredible partner Julie on Bumble in 2018.
  She is easily the best thing to happen to me in this entire paragraph. We have a nice little life
  together and things are generally good.
  My dad is still alive and my mom is still dead. I still like the Warriors and that whole bit about
  loving Carly Rae Jepsen turned out to be real. I'm as confused by that one as you are. Let's see,
  what else...what else? Oh. I've been on the same softball team for 11 years and I organize for
  racial justice with SURJ-NYC and the <a href="https://rappcampaign.com/" target="_blank">RAPP
    campaign</a>. I mostly eat a plant-based diet and I've been doing that for a decade or so. I'm
    also an uncle now and it rocks. I've missed you!
